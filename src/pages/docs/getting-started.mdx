# Getting Started

This page details what you should know before using WiiGolfQ, and the process on how to create your WiiGolfQ account and join a match.

## Things you should know beforehand

### The YouTube rule

All participants (except for NSS Score matches) **MUST** livestream their gameplay to YouTube. **NO EXCEPTIONS.** This is to prevent cheating.

Things you should know about this rule:
  - Capture card is not required.
    - Any video quality is allowed (a camera pointing at a TV is OK).
  - Audio (game audio or otherwise) is not required and **not recommended**.
  - Alternate YouTube accounts are allowed and **encouraged**.
  - The livestream can be public or unlisted.
  - DVR should be turned on (i.e. the VOD should be available after the livestream ends).
    - Please note: your VOD will be available on the WiiGolfQ website.

YouTube imposes a 24-hour cooldown for new accounts to livestream. If you are thinking about participating in WiiGolfQ, please activate this timer on your account now.

1. Go to [YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com).
2. Click `Create` -> `Go live`.

YouTube also imposes a 50 subscriber requirement for streaming directly from their official mobile app. Please use a third-party app if you are facing this restriction.

### Other rules

- Please have the game you are joining matches for... lol. You'd be surprised how many people don't follow this rule.
- Emulator is allowed for score matches. Emulator is **not allowed** for speedrun matches.
- Be vigilant that your opponent is being honest. If you do not catch that your opponent is not following the rules (not submitting the correct score, not livestreaming, etc.), that is on you.


## How to join a match

1. Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/23BzdNkrWU) and follow any necessary onboarding process.

3. Type parameters into the `/youtube` command (these can be changed at any time), then press `Enter` to send the command.
- `handle` (required): type in your YouTube handle without the `@`. If your YouTube channel link is `https://youtube.com/@MyYouTubeHandle123`, type `MyYouTubeHandle123`.
- `url` (optional): type in a URL to an unlisted YouTube livestream of yours, if you would like to livestream unlisted.

Now, you just have to wait until a match begins. You will get mentioned by the bot when this happens. See the [Playing a match](https://four.courses/docs/playing-a-match) section of the docs for instructions on how to play a match.
